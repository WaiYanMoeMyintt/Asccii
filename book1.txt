Git fetch is one of the latest features of git used to extract information of last updated commits, included branches and files from its remote repository with its related objects. This command of git is specially used to rebuild the previous history of the specific branch in which you have to do changes. One of the best things about it is it doesnâ€™t affect your local repository. By using it, you can make all changes from your remote repository and store them by creating your own folder on the local branch and if you want to add those changes in your related branch, then use git merge.
